# Markdown and React

You can write normal `.md` files or the more powerful `.mdx` format.

Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about) to import and use React components inside your Markdown file:

```markdown
import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

### Markdown With React Components

<Callout emoji="✅">
  **MDX** (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX.
  It receives an MDX string and outputs a _JSX string_. It does this by parsing
  the MDX document to a syntax tree and then generates a JSX document from that tree. 
</Callout>
```

Generates:

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

## Code Highlighting

Code highlighting with focused lines using

````markdown
```jsx highlight=2,3
function App() {
  // these 2 lines will be highlighted
  return <App>My JSX Code</App>
}
```
````

```jsx highlight=4,8
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```

Inline code: `let x = 1`.  
Multiple lines: `x += 1`.
