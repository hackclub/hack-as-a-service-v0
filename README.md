# Hack as a Service (HaaS)

## Development
Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run `docker-compose up` to run a local instance of Dokku and the bot. Any edits you save should make the bot restart automatically.

To open a shell in a container, run `docker exec -it hack-as-a-service_bot_1 bash` or `docker exec -it hack-as-a-service_dokku_1 bash`
