# HaaS Progress Report - May 2, 2021

Welcome back hackers! We have hit even more milestones recently with HaaS, so let's go over _all_ of them in detail.

**To recap,** what exactly is HaaS? Hack as a Service (or HaaS) is an HN-powered PaaS for Hack Clubbers (think [Heroku](https://heroku.com), but better) that aims to be inexpensive, powerful, and easy to get started with.

## Recap
