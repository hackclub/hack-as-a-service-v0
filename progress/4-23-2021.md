# HaaS Progress Report - April 23, 2021

üßë‚Äçüíª Hello hackers! This week has been a big one for HaaS, so this post will get you up to speed with the amazing development milestones we've hit recently.

‚ùì **To recap,** what exactly is HaaS? Hack as a Service (or HaaS) is an HN-powered PaaS for Hack Clubbers (think [Heroku](https://heroku.com), but better) that aims to be inexpensive, powerful, and easy to get started with.

## Recap

In the past two weeks we've hit a number of milestones, including:

- [@jasonappah](https://github.com/jasonappah) revived the project and kicked off development last Tuesday (April 13)

- [@makuzaverite](https://github.com/makuzaverite) added CI to the repository on the 14th

- [@cjdenio](https://github.com/cjdenio) purchased and set up a DigitalOcean droplet on Sunday, the 18th

- [@anirudhb](https://github.com/anirudhb) developed [`dokkud`](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service/tree/master/dokkud), a daemon that bridges the gap between the Go API and [Dokku](https://dokku.com) over JSON-RPC on a Unix socket

- [@cjdenio](https://github.com/cjdenio) bootstrapped a starter Next.js UI, visible at https://haas.hackclub.com

- [@jasonappah](https://github.com/jasonappah) built a sleek "App Not Found" page: https://thisappdoesntexist.haas.hackclub.com ([#16](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service/pull/16)) and [@cjdenio](https://github.com/cjdenio) acquired a wildcard SSL certificate

- [@anirudhb](https://github.com/anirudhb) did some database development with Postgres and [GORM](https://gorm.io) ([#13](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service/pull/13))

- [@cjdenio](https://github.com/cjdenio) wrote Slack-based user authentication, at https://haas.hackclub.com/login ([#21](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service/pull/21))

- [@sarthaktexas](https://github.com/sarthaktexas) did some [Figma mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/vGT8ifd6Em2YGy428kGQEg/Hack-as-a-Service?node-id=0%3A1) for the UI and he and [@sampoder](https://github.com/sampoder) began to figure out the frontend stack

## Looking forward

Next week, we'll be focused on app provisioning and billing. [@rishiosaur](https://github.com/rishiosaur) will be working on [rishiosaur/hn#10](https://github.com/rishiosaur/hn/issues/10), which will open up the ability for fractional billing based on resources used.

A huge thanks to everyone who's contributed in the past few days! We're always looking for new people to help out with the backend, frontend, and documentation, so don't hesitate to post in [#hack-as-a-service](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01N3B30TFB) if you'd like to lend a hand ‚úã!
